# CSC-370-Project
Project idea: Wiki for Champions in League of Legends

Base Requirements (Bare minimum for next sprint):
1: Every champion should have their base stats at level 1 (auto attack range, auto attack windup, armor, magic resist, hp, AD, AP, etc.) and release date, recorded and stored in a data base.
2: Database is able to be queried for things like, "List all champions in order of their auto attack range" and will output that list.

The reason behind these base requirements is not just as a means to start building a database and to be able to submit queries to it in a simple way, it's also because this sort of tool would be extremely helpful for me to be able to talk about the game to other people, team mates, coaches, etc, and to help me ask questions and get fast answers. While all of this information is already publicly availiable, there is no tool that will generate a list of these stats automatically, only tables that might be up on the fandom wiki for the game if somebody chose to put it there. A large goal of mine would be to build the tool to be able to answer questions and generate tables of information quickly.

I personally believe the wiki to be a great idea for a course project as allowing people to edit information based on permissions is interesting to work around. Also, since League of Legends is a game that releases on patches every two weeks, it's a consistently changing project that requires data modification and entry frequently, which generates an interesting requirement of adaptability and change history/logging, as each patch will generate a new list of changes, but also being able to go back and look at older patches is important as well. Additionally, this project has the potential to grow into something the community can use to document champion specific interactions or to log bugs, which would be great to have a tool to help document and find that information quickly.

As of right now though the project is more or less going to be a simple table, every champion, certain stats, can we compare and create queries on those stats and generate lists? The project can get overly complicated very quickly and fall out of scope for what I'm able to do on my own so I am trying to keep my expectations in check.

Thanks for reading, have a nice day! :)
